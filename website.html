        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>At Blue Canvas Creative, I build websites that will have the ‘wow’ factor. Their 
            appearance will be stunning and it will look that way on all devices. When I say 
            the websites are customized I mean it as they are built to your specifications.</p>
        <p>
                Designing a stunning website is only the first step. Maintaining your website is 
                key to a successful business. In order to keep a flow of traffic to your website, 
                it needs to be tailored to the user. It's imperative user experience becomes 
                user-friendly. Or you will have less traffic to your website. Content needs to be 
                fresh and relevant in order for your website to be high in Google rankings.
